389. Find the Difference

You are given two strings s and t. String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"


Code:

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        count_s, count_t = Counter(s), Counter(t)
        
        for i in count_t:
            if i not in count_s:
                return i
            elif count_s[i] < count_t[i]:
                return i
